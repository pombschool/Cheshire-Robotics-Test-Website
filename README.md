# Cheshire-Robotics-Test-Website
This project is an experimentation of the cheshirerobotics.org website. Any changes to how that website should look will be tested here in different branches. This is the main branch. Any information about other branches or this branch will be made to this README file. 

## Main Branch
This is the first design idea for the Cheshire Robotics website. Made by Sudhamsu.

1) The About Us Page

This page contains the major aspects of what FIRST is and our role in it. It will also contain the most up-to-date information about how Team 999 is structured. It will also give information about the mentors on the team.
